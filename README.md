v2.31.1

HAY GUISE
This is a small update to add the new Hotline Miami DLC Heist to the Job selection menu. Also, in case you haven't already noticed, Preplanning (at least in the Miami heist) is broked good. So this update offers a bandage to that issue, which is to remove increased favors. If you want to re-enable them again, simply go to your root Payday 2 folder and scripts\config\ACPCore.lua
Check line 11 for the commented out post require script "increasedfavors.lua" and simply remove the comment and save to reinstate it.

**NOTE**
As of 10/9/2014 @ 1:55AM this is NOT a part of the official ACP release.
